Flappy Bird Project - README
Project Description
This is a Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library. The project simulates a 2D game where the player controls a small bird that must fly between vertically moving obstacles (pipes) without colliding with them. The game includes visual effects such as animated clouds and a scrolling ground, along with sound effects for flapping, scoring, and crashing when the bird hits an obstacle.

Features:
Animated Bird: A yellow bird with 3 animated frames that must fly through pipes.
Dynamic Obstacles: Vertical obstacles (pipes) that appear with increasing difficulty and move from right to left.
Realistic Clouds: Randomly generated clouds with rounded, shaded shapes that drift across the sky.
Scrolling Ground: An animated ground that continuously scrolls from right to left to enhance the illusion of movement.
Sound Effects: Wing flapping, score counting, and collision effects provide an engaging auditory experience.
Camera Scroll Effect: The camera follows the bird horizontally, simulating an infinite forward flight.
Dynamic Difficulty: With each score, the game speed increases slightly, making it progressively harder.
Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used for all game logic and control.
Pygame: The library used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI), handling animations, and managing game logic.
Pygame Gfxdraw: A Pygame extension used for generating more complex visual effects, such as clouds with shading and highlights.
NumPy: Used to generate sound waves and create simple sound effects like flapping or crashing.
Gameplay Instructions
Start: The game begins in the "Start" mode. Press the Spacebar (SPACE) to start the game.
Fly: Keep the bird in the air by pressing the Spacebar. Each press makes the bird flap and rise.
Objective: Avoid the vertical obstacles (pipes). If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game ends.
Scoring: Each time the bird successfully flies between two pipes, the player earns a point.
Game Over: After a collision, the current score and the high score are displayed. Press the Spacebar (SPACE) to restart the game.
Installation and Execution
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Pygame 2.x
Installation:
Install Pygame: Ensure that Pygame is installed. Run the following command in the console:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame numpy
Run the Game: Save the code in a Python file (e.g., flappy_bird.py) and run the script:

bash
Copy code
python flappy_bird.py
Code Structure
create_bird_images(): This function generates three different animation frames for the bird, which are cycled to simulate flapping motion.
create_pipe_image(): Creates the vertical pipe obstacles that the bird must avoid.
Cloud Class: This class generates and controls the animated clouds in the background. The clouds consist of multiple ellipses with highlights and shadows to give them a soft, realistic appearance.
create_sound(): Creates sound effects (e.g., flapping, collision) by using sine waves to modulate frequencies.
Bird Class: Represents the bird controlled by the player. This class contains the logic for movement, gravity, flapping, and collision detection.
Pipe Class: Represents the vertical obstacles. Pipes spawn on the right and move to the left.
Camera Class: Simulates a camera that follows the bird, creating a scrolling view.
draw_background(): Draws the scrolling background, including the ground and animated clouds.
Game Flow
The game starts in the start mode. The player presses the Spacebar (SPACE) to control the bird.
The bird is affected by gravity and will fall unless the player presses the Spacebar to make it flap and rise.
Obstacles (pipes) continuously move from right to left. The player must avoid these obstacles by flying the bird between them.
If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game enters the game_over mode.
The current score and the high score are displayed, and the player can restart the game by pressing the Spacebar (SPACE).
Enhancements and Improvements
Enhanced Clouds: The clouds are dynamically generated, consist of multiple ellipses, and include highlights and shadows for added realism.
Increased Difficulty: The game speed increases slightly with each score, providing a progressive difficulty challenge.
